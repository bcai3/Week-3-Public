    "In many different cases, we might have a model for how a system works, and want to fit that model to a set of observations. \n",
    "\n",
    "We're going to investigate the process of fitting using a classic paper that proposed a model for the [T cell receptor](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11606269). Here, the authors develop a mathematical model for how binding occurs and then have observations of how much binding occurs under specific conditions. Identifying whether and how this model fits has led to a better understanding of how our immune system utilizes antibodes, and efforts to design antibodies that function more potently."
